The web app is a credit card checker based on Luhn's algorithm. It is a solution to the credit card checker challenge on the codecademy.com JavaScript course.

You can test the app using your credit card or generating fake credit cards.

I don't know much design but I used [**uigradients**](uigradients.com) to generate the gradient I used in the container then selected a lighter shade of it for the body.
